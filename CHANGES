1.30-xx changes from 1.22-06   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Fixed minor bug that would allow incorrect site totals for the
   first day of the month under certain conditions.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added Top Entry and Exit Page tables.  Added configuration file
   keywords TopEntry (-e command line) and TopExit (-E command line)
   to specify the number of entries to display for each table.  The
   default for both is 10.  See README for additional information.

 o Added 'Group' labels.  Allows display of a specified label for
   grouped entries (in 'Top' tables).  Based on patch submitted
   by Oliver Graf (ograf@rhein-zeitung.de).  See sample.conf for
   examples.

 o Added 'Visits' totals.  The length of time that constitutes a
   'visit' can be set using the VisitTimeout configuration keyword
   (-m command line option).  The value must be given in HHMMSS
   format, you can omit leading zeros. Default is 30 minutes (3000).

 o Added 'Pages' totals, based on user specified extensions.  Changes
   made to generated graphs as well.  Configuration keyword PageType
   (and command line -P switch) allows specification of extensions
   to use (defaults to 'htm*' and 'cgi').  Also called "pageviews".

 o Added Search String analysis.  Keyword 'TopSearch' defines how
   many of the top search strings to display.  Default is 20. Can
   be disabled by using zero (0).

 o Added native support for ftp logs (xferlog ala wu-ftpd).  Added
   'LogType' configuration file keyword (-F command line option)
   to specify log type.  Values can be either 'web' or 'ftp', with
   the default of 'web'.

 o Changed graphs to handle pages and visits totals. Also  added
   color coded legends, which can be disabled using the GraphLegend
   configuration keyword (-L command line option).  Default is to
   display them.

 o Added background lines to graphs.  Default is 2 lines, and can
   be set to any number using the GraphLines configuration keyword
   (-l command line option).  Can use anywhere from none (0) to
   twenty lines.  They will be drawn in all but the country graph.

 o Added CountryGraph configuration file keyword (-Y command line
   option) to enable/disable display of country usage pie chart.

 o Added FoldSeqErr keyword (-f command line option).  Normally,
   the program will ignore log records that are out of sequence
   (chronological order).  This option lets them be folded into
   the analysis anyway, as if the were the same date/time as the
   last good record.  Apache users can safely ignore :)

 o Added additonal 'Top' tables for SITES and URL's, sorted by
   KBytes instead of hits.  Two new configuration file keywords,
   TopKSites and TopKURLs, can be used to specify the number of
   entries for each (zero to disable).  Default for both is 10.

 o Added additional calculations for max/avg files, pages, visits
   and KBytes in monthly statistics.

 o Updated generated HTML code to fully comply with the HTML 4.0
   Transitional spec.  DOCTYPE header reflects this change as well.

 o Changed code to use 4 digit years in filenames.  Purely for the
   Y2K phobes who couldn't deal with only two digits (even though
   it was _purely_ for humans, the program couldn't care less).
   Unfortunately, this means that you will have to rename previous
   month files to the new format.  Not a big deal if you plan on
   re-running all your logs to take advantage of the new features.

 o Major changes to both history file and incremental file formats
   to handle additional totals (pages/visits data).  As a result,
   this version is INCOMPATABLE with previous versions.  See the
   file README.FIRST for important information on upgrading.

 o Language files and documentation updated for new functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.22-xx changes from 1.20-11   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Fixed bug in country total generation.  Caused country table
   to show bogus entries if logs contain hostnames that were not
   fully qualified (ie: don't have the domain name/TLD portion).

 o Changed/fixed incremental data I/O routines to better detect and
   handle error conditions.  This involved some minor incremental
   data file format changes as well.  Fixes problem large sites were
   having where random tables were getting munged.

 o Fixed record parse code to better detect and strip query portion
   from URL's and Referrer strings.

 o Fixed segfault condition when more than MAX_CTRY entries were
   specified for the "Top Countries" table.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added code to detect negative byte transfer sizes in logs (another
   netscape server kludge :)  Could cause KByte xfer sizes to become
   corrupt.

 o Several small changes (mostly ifdef/endif's) to make code compile
   clean 'out-of-the-box' across more platforms (ala SunOS).  Also
   added a GNU autoconf 'configure' script which helps a bit as well.

 o Added Include* keywords.  Allows forcing the inclusion of specified
   log records.  Takes precedence over counterpart Ignore* keywords.

 o Added HTMLPre, HTMLBody, HTMLEnd and HTMLExtension keywords, and
   changed behaviour of HTMLHead keyword.  Previous versions need
   only change the 'HTMLHead' keword in existing files to 'HTMLBody'
   to upgrade.  Thanks to Colin Viebrock <cmv@privateworld.com> for
   the idea and code examples.

 o Changed mangle agent code to support Opera and other browsers.
   Also updated response codes to IETF HTTP/1.1 Rev 6 draft.
   Thanks to Yves Lafon <ylafon@w3.org> for this these.

 o Added HistoryName and IncrementalName keywords, which allow the
   specification of the history and incremental data filenames.

 o Added UseHTTPS keyword, which allows using 'https://' instead
   of 'http://' for links to URLS in the 'Top URL's' table.  Also
   added check for URL's that already have the protocol specified
   (such as on virtual web and proxy servers), and to use unmodified
   if found (will only force to lowercase for matching).

 o Added code to ignore out-of-sequence log records.

 o Added code to force hostnames to lowercase (was causing country skew).

 o Disabled display of blank (zero hit) days at start of daily stat table.

 o Added records per second calculation to timing totals.

 o ALT= tags now use translated strings instead of forcing english.

 o Updated documentation for new functions/features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.20-xx changes from 1.12-10   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Modified record parse routine to not touch stuff between quotes
   (").  Was causing problems parsing some malformed request fields.

 o Fixed memory leak in MangleAgent code, and relocated to elimitate
   un-necessary processing (causing segfault on some machines).

Changes/Additions:
 o Changed transfer totals on host/url structures to support large
   groupings (such as *.gif) on heavly hit servers.  Hopefully, this
   should cure the 32bit overflow problem large sites were having.

 o Changed daily transfer totals to support transfers greater than
   roughly 4.2 gigabytes a day.

 o Added some missing HTML tags and altered the way totals are
   calculated on the 'Top' tables (to correct for grouped records).

 o Added incremental run capability (-p command line option or
   "Incremental" configuration file keyword).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1x-xx changes from 1.00-05   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Re-wrote the Group* logic, fixing a bug that allowed hiding of
   objects when they shouldn't be.

 o Fixed broken IgnoreReferrer code.

 o Modified config parse code to handle extended characters.

 o Misc. minor bug fixes/changes.  Added a missing fclose.

 o Cleaned up generated HTML.

 o Fixed duplicate warnings on large referrer fields.

 o Fixed country table bug adding grouped records to totals.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added GroupSite, GroupReferrer and GroupAgent keywords to round
   out the Group* configuration options.

 o Added GroupShading and GroupHighlight keywords to allow selective
   highlight and shading on grouped rows in table.

 o Removed the '-L' command line option.  Groupings can now only
   be specified from a configuration file.  Language files changed
   to reflect change.

 o Added '-V' command line option (identical to '-v') for version.

 o Added additional language support.  Language files will be marked
   /* New for 1.1 */ where changes have been made.

 o Various rewrites to streamline the code, accomidate the new
   group options and make things easier down the road when I implement
   incremental (partial log) processing.

 o Usual README and CHANGES documentation updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.00-xx changes from 0.99-06   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Modify record parser so that spaces in usernames (auth field)
   don't cause record to be skipped (w/'Bad Record' message).

 o Included various error conditions that were being ignored in
   the timing statistics ('bad records' value) totals.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added GMTTime (-g) option to force display of timestamps in
   GMT (UTC) time instead of local timezone.

 o Added GroupURL (-L) option for grouping of URL's as if they
   were a single object.  See README for details.

 o Language support in the form of a language specific header
   file containing all strings used by The Webalizer.  English
   file is used by default unless changed.  Support for other
   languages will be distributed as I receive them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
0.99-xx changes from 0.98-16   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

0.99 is mostly a bug-fix release, with a few added extra goodies.

Fixes:
 o Fixed monthly total transfer size (silent) overflow problem.

 o Fixed the numerous fprintf format errors.  Only seemed to wreak havok
   on non-intel machines though.

 o Fixed core dump condition on certain machines when using stdin for
   input.

 o Fixed floating point code that caused divide by zero errors on some
   platforms (most noticably on SCO OpenServer).

 o Netscape server kludges:  Added code to deal with Netscape log header
   record gracefully.  Also added workaround for timestamp error where
   Netscape sometimes makes a day have 0-24 hours instead of 0-23.  The
   Webalizer will now treat anything greater than 23 as 0.

 o Resized some fixed field sizes to gain memory usage improvements.

Changes/Additions:
 o Ignore* config keywords added.  This allows you to completely ignore
   certain log records based on site name, URL, user agent or referrer.
   * Use will cause inaccurate statistics results.  See documentation.

 o ReallyQuiet config keyword (-Q command line option) added.  Causes
   The Webalizer to supress _all_ messages.  Useful for cron jobs.

 o Removed the "Sites" total at the bottom of the summary by month.
   The total for sites is a useless number and produces a misleadingly
   high value which detracts from the accuracy of the other totals.

 o Updated README and CHANGES
