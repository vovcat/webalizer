1.2x-xx changes from 1.12-10   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Modified record parse routine to not touch stuff between quotes
   (").  Was causing problems parsing some malformed request fields.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added incremental run capability (-p command line option or
   "Incremental" configuration file keyword).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1x-xx changes from 1.00-05   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Re-wrote the Group* logic, fixing a bug that allowed hiding of
   objects when they shouldn't be.

 o Fixed broken IgnoreReferrer code.

 o Modified config parse code to handle extended characters.

 o Misc. minor bug fixes/changes.  Added a missing fclose.

 o Cleaned up generated HTML.

 o Fixed duplicate warnings on large referrer fields.

 o Fixed country table bug adding grouped records to totals.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added GroupSite, GroupReferrer and GroupAgent keywords to round
   out the Group* configuration options.

 o Added GroupShading and GroupHighlight keywords to allow selective
   highlight and shading on grouped rows in table.

 o Removed the '-L' command line option.  Groupings can now only
   be specified from a configuration file.  Language files changed
   to reflect change.

 o Added '-V' command line option (identical to '-v') for version.

 o Added additional language support.  Language files will be marked
   /* New for 1.1 */ where changes have been made.

 o Various rewrites to streamline the code, accomidate the new
   group options and make things easier down the road when I implement
   incremental (partial log) processing.

 o Usual README and CHANGES documentation updates.

1.00-xx changes from 0.99-06   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
 o Modify record parser so that spaces in usernames (auth field)
   don't cause record to be skipped (w/'Bad Record' message).

 o Included various error conditions that were being ignored in
   the timing statistics ('bad records' value) totals.

Changes/Additions:
 o Added GMTTime (-g) option to force display of timestamps in
   GMT (UTC) time instead of local timezone.

 o Added GroupURL (-L) option for grouping of URL's as if they
   were a single object.  See README for details.

 o Language support in the form of a language specific header
   file containing all strings used by The Webalizer.  English
   file is used by default unless changed.  Support for other
   languages will be distributed as I receive them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
0.99-xx changes from 0.98-16   (brad@mrunix.net)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

0.99 is mostly a bug-fix release, with a few added extra goodies.

Fixes:
 o Fixed monthly total transfer size (silent) overflow problem.

 o Fixed the numerous fprintf format errors.  Only seemed to wreak havok
   on non-intel machines though.

 o Fixed core dump condition on certain machines when using stdin for
   input.

 o Fixed floating point code that caused divide by zero errors on some
   platforms (most noticably on SCO OpenServer).

 o Netscape server kludges:  Added code to deal with Netscape log header
   record gracefully.  Also added workaround for timestamp error where
   Netscape sometimes makes a day have 0-24 hours instead of 0-23.  The
   Webalizer will now treat anything greater than 23 as 0.

 o Resized some fixed field sizes to gain memory usage improvements.

Changes/Additions:
 o Ignore* config keywords added.  This allows you to completely ignore
   certain log records based on site name, URL, user agent or referrer.
   * Use will cause inaccurate statistics results.  See documentation.

 o ReallyQuiet config keyword (-Q command line option) added.  Causes
   The Webalizer to supress _all_ messages.  Useful for cron jobs.

 o Removed the "Sites" total at the bottom of the summary by month.
   The total for sites is a useless number and produces a misleadingly
   high value which detracts from the accuracy of the other totals.

 o Updated README and CHANGES
