Description: Web server log analysis program
 The Webalizer is a web server log analysis program. It is designed to scan
 web server log files in various formats and produce usage statistics in
 HTML format for viewing through a browser.
 The Webalizer produces yearly, monthly, daily and hourly statistics. In the
 monthly reports, various statistics may be produced to show overall usage,
 usage by day and hour, usage by visiting sites, URLs, user agents
 (browsers), referrers and country. The Webalizer is highly configurable by
 use of either command line options or a configuration file, allowing the
 program to be tailored to individual needs easily.
