# Buffer overflow while parsing squid logs
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=218889
# From: Torsten <torsten.hilbrich@gmx.net>
#
# Note: I also reported this bug to upstream author (Bradford L. Barret).
#
# While checking the results of webalizer (the transfer volume was much
# too large) we noticed a buffer overflow while parsing the squid logs.
# This buffer overflows modifies the xfer_size used in the result pages of
# webalizer.
#
# In the function parse_record_squid there is a little bug when
# constructing the eos variable to limit the copy operation while
# processing the HTTP URL.  The same destination buffer is used as for the
# HTTP request type however, the eos is calculated once again based on the
# cp1 variable no longer pointing to the begin.  If the request url is
# longer than about 1020 characters, the xfer_size element of the logrec
# struct will get overwritten.
#
# The attach squid.log file contains an example line that exploits the
# bug.  The "123" characters at the end of the url are those written into
# xfer_size (at least on my machine).
#
# The patch shown below (based on the debian source) removes the
# recalculation of eos and is therefore avoiding the overflow of the
# logrec.url buffer.
#
# The patch is the same as send upstream shifted by 3 lines (due to
# debians changes on the source).

# webalizer buffer overflow prevention patch
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=166126
# From: Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>
#
# Just fixed several "potential" buffer overflows, most of them most
# likely wouldn't be overflown without some weird local configuration
# (like changed language settings), but I just wanted to be sure.
#
# The first parser.c change fixes also ftp parser overflowing timestamp
# from log file. Not a remotely overflowable either.

# webalizer: various buffer overflows
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=343877
# From: Ulf Harnhammar <metaur@telia.com>
#
# I have found some more buffer overflows in webalizer. People from Debian seem to
# have worked on this earlier on, and here are some more bugs to fix. None of them
# seem to have any security impact.
#
# The first overflow occurs when parsing FTP xfer log files, specifically the IDENT
# part which can write far beyond its limits. During my testing, I was unable to
# make this bug crash the program because of the way things are laid out in memory,
# but I still think it is worth fixing, as writing outside of char buffers in C is
# a serious matter. You can test it with the attached ftplog.txt file (but you have
# to add a printf() statement to verify that the overflow occurs).
#
# The second overflow occurs when parsing webalizer.conf, where bad config files cause
# Segmentation faults. I have attached a webalizer.conf file that causes this problem
# in two different ways.
#
# The third overflow is an off-by-one bug in the DNS handling.
